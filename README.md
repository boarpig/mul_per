# Calculating multiplicative persistence

Following is a direct quote from Wikipedia:

For a radix of 10, there is thought to be no number with a multiplicative persistence > 11: this is known to be true for numbers up to 10^20000.

The smallest numbers with persistence 0, 1, ... are:

    0, 10, 25, 39, 77, 679, 6788, 68889, 2677889, 26888999, 3778888999, 277777788888899. 
    (sequence A003001 in the OEIS)
    
The search for these numbers can be sped up by using additional properties of the decimal digits of these record-breaking numbers. These digits must be sorted, and, except for the first two digits, all digits must be 7, 8, or 9.
